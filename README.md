**BMI Patient Screener:**<br />
BMI Screener aims to provide a solution to monitoring
patients during follow-up visits by calculating and 
flagging concerning BMI interpretations. This app is 
designed to provide medical health professionals in 
the division of cardiology a screening log for their 
patients. 

This project is of interest as it is a tool
that could provide valuable source documentation
and raise awareness to the potential risks of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Higher BMI categories
and overweight is found to be associated with 
increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age (Khan et al.)


## Functionality

*Tasks:*
- Create a patient screen log to add patients to
- Read new patients into the log with a calculated BMI score
- Update patient values and produce new calculation per each follow-up visit
- Delete patients who are no longer being followed

## User Stories

*Specific outcomes:*
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new patient and add it to a list of patients
- As a user, I want to be able to select a patient and add/calculate a BMI score to that patient
- As a user, I want to be able to select a patient and view the BMI score logged for that patient
- As a user, I want to be able to select a patient and add any new measurements for that patient
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a patient that is no longer being followed-up


## Programming 

*Purpose:*
- Design and develop a functional program using Java (IntelliJ)
- Incorporate testing with the use of JUnit
