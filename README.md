# BMI Patient Screener

BMI Screener aims to provide a solution to patient monitoring 
during follow-up visits by calculating and 
flagging concerning body mass index (BMI) interpretations. This app is 
designed to provide medical health professionals a screening log 
for their patients. 

This project is of interest as it would be a readily accessible tool
that could provide valuable source documentation
and raise awareness to the potential risks of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Higher BMI categories
and overweight is found to be associated with 
increased risk of developing CVD at an earlier age (Khan et al.)

*BMI Score Interpretations* <br />
| BMI | Weight Status | 
 --- | --- 
| Below 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 - 24.9 | Healthy Weight |
| 25.0 - 29.9 | Overweight |
| 30.0 and Above | Obesity |


## Functionality

*Tasks:*
- Create a patient screen log to add patients seen
- Read new patients into the log with a calculated BMI score
- Update patient values and produce new calculation per each follow-up visit (under construction)
- Delete patients who are no longer being followed

## User Stories

*Specific outcomes:*
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new patient, calculate their BMI, and add them the screen log
- As a user, I want to be able to select a patient and view the BMI score logged for that patient
- As a user, I want to be able to view a user-friendly log of all the screened patients and their logged scores
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a patient that is no longer being followed-up from the screen log
- As a user, I want to be able to pull a single log of all patients screened for export
- As a user, I want to be able to save my BMI patient list to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my BMI patient list from file


## Programming 

*Purpose:*
- Design and develop a functional program using Java (IntelliJ)
- Incorporate testing with the use of JUnit
